### Default credentials

```
username: admin
password: admin
```

You must change the password and, if you can, the username for the best security possible.

### Configuration

By default, the root path is set to `/home/yunohost.app/filebrowser`. You can choose a different root path in filebrowser configuration file: `/var/www/filebrowser/settings.json` and modify *root* entry as desired. (you may need to set the correct permissions for the new path).
